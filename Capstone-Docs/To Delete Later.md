## Notes of things that need to be filled out
- [x] Reference figures in the relevant sections
- [x] Study Section needs updates
- [ ] Design Overview has notes of sections I needed help filling out
- [ ] Bus communication, whether it is combined with I2C or not.
- [ ] SPI if not deleted
- [ ] CAN if not deleted
- [ ] Controller and Estimator Design isn't finished/ may need to be adjusted in content for new scope
- [ ] Python Notes and IMU publisher could use some explanation
- [ ] Numpy if not deleted
- [ ] Actuators
- [ ] SLAM

## Notes of things to be combined
- [ ] Bus Communication and I2C if thats the only relevant one
- [ ] MPU6050 Config and Sensor SetUp?

## Notes of things that might be able to be deleted (no longer in scope)
- [ ] Review the documents and ensure relevance
- [ ] SPI
- [ ] CAN
- [ ] Numpy
- [ ] Alpha-Beta-Gamma 

## Notes of things to add pages for
- [ ] Potentially pictures of wired up sensors/ the finished Picar
- [ ] Commands and links for Pi nano Encoder setup
- [ ] Commands and links for when sensor fusion begins
- [ ] Document sensor fusion/kalman filter process
- [x] Outside Testing Process

## Notes of things to clean up
- [ ] Sensor SetUp needs to be cleaned up and designed its final function/purpose because it seems to jump around and have no explanation.
- [ ] PiCar Modelling and Simulation has a few empty sections.
- [ ] Need to decide on one format for sensors and electronics
- [x] Clean up and actually write up System Identification instead of just having it as notes.
- [ ] Need to clean up the links in estimators and add extended kalman filter, kalman filter, and sensor fusion as links (and maybe put them in a folder) perhaps alpha-beta-gamma too

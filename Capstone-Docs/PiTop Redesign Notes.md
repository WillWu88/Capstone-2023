## Step 1: Making the original file in Solidworks 

- Completed a full remodeling of the current PiTop car on Solidworks utilizing the current specifications of the PiTop and adding in one set of screw holes for the Lidar mounting and adding one set of holes to mount the PiTop on the PiCar.

## Step 2: Redesign

- Created a redesign of the model to new preferred specs for an emphasis on speed.
	- Thinned out both the base of the PiTop and the platform.

- Also added in features to connect the halves of the PiTop together as the PiTop must be 3D printed in two parts due to printing size limitations.
	- First design has screw holes to connect the two halves.

## Step 3: 3D Printing in the Makerspace

- The next step in 3D printing the PiTop is getting certified in the Jubel Makerspace.
	- Utilizing the link above, enrolled in the Jubel SLMP Makerspace extended learning canvas page.
	- Earned the “AY 2022-2023 Orientation”, “3D Printing – Know the Basics”, and “3D Slicing with PreForm (Form 3)” badges, which fulfills the requirements needed to be allowed to 3D print in the Makerspace.

- Then utilizing the 3D printerOs webpage, slice and queue up the 3D print .STL sketch for printing.

## Step 4: First Test of the New PiTop

## I. Overall timeline

- Our overall project contains three stages. Though the details might change, the overall theme of each stage will remain largely the same throughout the semester, guided by control system design principles.
- The <ins>first</ins> stage begins with [[PiCar Modelling and Simulation]], where we model the PiCar mathematically and simulate the system Numerically. 
	- We will also conduct [[System Identification]] experiments, where we identify actuator dynamics
- The <ins>second</ins> stage targets [[Controller and Estimator Design]], where we design controller and estimator systems for the PiCar. We want our system to have a robust backbone
- The <ins>third</ins> stage builds on the two preceeding pages and builds high-level navigation algorithms. Our system is loaded with Lidar, an advance sensor that enables advanced navigation algorithms. Refer to [[Navigation Design]]

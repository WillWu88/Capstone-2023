Abstract Summary:
Aim of the acticle is to develop a GPS/IMU Multisensor fusion algorithm. The algorithm was made by fusing GPS and IMU data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Because the lack of credibility of GPS signal in some cases and because of the drift of the INS, so to avoid this problem authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the IMU.

Abstract Summary: USV navigation, needs to avoid obstacles and carry out automatic movements. One of the siluations is to correct the error of the sensors by GPS/IMU fusion. Using the Unscented Kalman filter sensor fusion, two scenarios were conducted in simulations: results showed position estimate in Scenario II was better.

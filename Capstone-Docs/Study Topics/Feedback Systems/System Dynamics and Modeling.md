## Modeling Concepts

- A model is a mathematical representation of numerical information in a system, which allows us to make predictions about a system will behave.

- In a dynamical system, the effects of actions don't occue immediately. (as in pressing a gas pedal)

- The state of a dynamical system is a collection of variables that completely characterizrs the motion of a system for the purpose of predicting future motion. Where the set of all possible states is the state space.

- ODE's (ordinary differential equations) are a common way of representing dynamical systems.

- The development of state space models combined the ODE models with the external actuators and sensots and utilizing more general forms of equations.

- In multidomain systems, smaller subsystems are described and the interfaces are determined by the behavior of interconnected subsystems, and combining these descriptions allows for the complete model.

- Vectors of the state variables, control variables, and the measured signal.

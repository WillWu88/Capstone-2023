- Introduces the concept of observability and show that if a system is observable, it is possible to recover the state from measurements of the inputs and outputs to the system

### 7.1 Observability

- It will be shown that computation of the states can be carried out by a dynamical system called an observer.

#### Definition of Observability

- An observer uses the process measurement y, possibly corrupted by noise n and the input u to estimate the current state of the process.

- *Observability*: A linear system is observable if for any $T > 0$ it is possible to determine the state of the system x(T) through measurements of y(t) and u(t) on the interval (0,T).

- If a system is observable, then there are no "hidden" dynamics inside it; we can understand everything that is going on through observation (over time) of the inputs and outputs.

- *Sensor Fusion* is the process of reconciling signals from many sensors with mathematical models.

#### Testing for Observability

- We wish to understand when it is possible to determine the state from observatons of the output.

- The output itself gives the projection of the state on vectors that are rows of the matrix C.

- It turns out that we need not consider any derivatives higher than n-1

- The calculation can easily be extended to systems with inputs.

- The state is then given by a linear combination of inputs and outputs and their higher derivatives.
	- The observability criterion is unchanged.

- Theorem 7.1: (*Observability rank condition*) A linear system of the form is observable if and only if the observability matrix $W_o$ is full rank.

- Example 7.1 Compartment model pg 215

#### Observable Canonical Form

- As in the case of reachability, it turns out that if a system is observable then there always exists a transformation T that converts the system into observable canonical form.

### 7.2 State Estimation

- We will look for observers that can be represented as a linear dynamical system that takes the inputs and outputs of a system we are observing and produces an estimate of the system's state.

#### The Observer

- We can attempt to determine the state simply by simulating the qeuations with the correct input.

- When both the observer and estimator are going to 0 we must require that the system be stable, and essentially our estimator converges.
	- Not useful in a control design context since we want to have our estimator converge quicky to a nonzero state s that we can make use of it in our controller.

- The observer design problem is the dual of the state feedback design problem.

- Theorem 7.2 (Observer design by eigenvalue assinment).
	- *Consider the system given by* $dx/dt = Ax + Bu$ $y=Cx$ *with one input and one output. Let* $lamba(s) = s^{n} + a_{1}s^{n-1}+ ... +a_{n-1}s + a_{n}$ *be the characeristic polynomial for A. If the system is observable, then the dynamical system* $dx_{hat}/dt = Ax_{hat} + Bu + L(y-C*x_{hat}$ *is an observer for the system, with L chosen as ..* see page 220 for matricies.

- $dx_{hat}/dt = Ax_{hat} + Bu + L(y-C*x_{hat}$ is called an observer for (the states of) the system because it will generate an approimation of the states of the  system from its inputs and outputs.
	- The form of an observer is a much more useful form than the one given by pure differentiation in equation.

- Example 7.2 Compartment model page 220

- The observer gain L is a matrix that tells how the error e is weighted and distributed among the states.
	- The observer thus combines measurements with a dynamical model of the system.

#### Computing the Observer Gain 

- For simple low-order problems it is convenient to introduce the elements of the observer gain L as unknown parameters and solve for the values required to give the desired characteristic polynomial.

### 7.3 Control Using Estimated State

- Theorem 7.3 (Eigenvalue assignment by output feedback)
	- *This polynomcial can be assigned arbitrary roots if the system is reachable and observable*

- The controller has a strong intitive appeal: it can be thought of as being composed of two parts, one state feedback and one observer.

- The feedback gain K can be computed as if all state variables can be measured , and it depends only on A and B.

- The property that the eigenvalue assignment for output feedback can be seperated into an eigenvalue assignment for a state feedback and an observer is called the *seperation principle*

- *Internal model principle*: the controller contains a codel of the process being controlled.

- Book example 7.4 Vehicle Steering pg 226

### 7.4 Kalman Filtering

- [[Kalman Filter]]

- One of the principal uses of observers in practice is to estimate the state of a system in the presence of *noisy* measurements.

- The Kalman filter has the *recursive* filter: given mean square error at time *k*, we can compute how the estimate and error *change*.

- The Kalman filter gives the estimate *and* the error covariance, so we can see how reliable the estimate is.
	- Also extracts the maximum possible information about output data.

- The Kalman filter is extremely versatile and can be used even if the process, noise or disturbances are nonstationary.

- We see that the optimal gain depends on both the process noise and the measurement noise, but in a nontrivial way.
	- Like the use of LQR to choose state feedback gains, the Kalman filter permits a systematic derivation of the oberver gains given a description of the noise processes.

- Theorem 7.5: *The optimal estimator has the form of a linear observer* pg 229 of the textbook.

- Example 7.5: Vectored thrust aircraft pg 229

### 7.5 A General Controller Structure

- State estimators and state feedback are important components of a controller.

#### Feedforward

- A more sophisticated controller consists of three parts:
 1)  An observer that computes estimates of the states based on a model and measured process inputs and outputs
 2) A state feedback
 3) A trajectory generator that generates the desired behavior of all states $x_{d}$ and a feedforward signal $u_{ff}$

- To generate the signal $u_{ff}$, we must also have a model of the inverse of the process dynamics.

- This controller is saif to have *two degrees of freedom* because the responses to command signals and disturbances are decoupled.

- Disturbance responses are governed by the observer and the state feedback, while the response to command signals is governed by the trajectory generator (feedforward).

- A *gain scheduled* linear controller with *feedforward* $u_{ff}$:
 $u = -K(x_{d})(x-x_{d})+u_{ff})$
- The form of the observer shown on page 232 is known as an *extended Kalman filter* and has proved to be a very effective means of estimating the state of a nonlinear system.

- The internal model principle applies: the controller contains a model of the system to be controlled through the observer.

- Example 7.6: Vehicle steering is on page 233

#### Kalman's Decomposition of a Linear System

- Two fundamental properties of a linear input/output system are reachability and observability, which can also be used to classify the dynamics of a system.

- Kalman's decomposition theorem, which says a linear system can be divided into four subsystems:
	- Reachable and observable 
	- Reachable but not observable
	- Not reachable but observable
	- Not reachable nor observable

- From the input/output point of view, it is only the reachable and observable dynamics that matter.

- Book example 7.7: System and controller with feedback from observer states page 236

#### Computer Implementation

- Controllers obtained so far have been described bt ordinary differential equations.

- A computer-controlled system typically operates periodically: every cycle, signals from the sensors are sampled and converted to digital form by the A/D converter, the control signal is computed and the resulting output is converted to analog form for the actuators. 

- The number of computations between reading the analog input and setting the analog output has been minimized by updating the state after the analog output has been set.

- There are more sophisticated ways of approximating a differential equation by a difference equation.

- It is necessary to filter measured signals before they are sampled so that the filtered signal has little frequency content above $f_{s}/2$, where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency.
	- This avoids a phenomena called *aliasing*

- If controllers with integral action are used, it is also necessary to provide protection so that the integral does not become too large when the actuator saturates.
	- This issue is known as *integrator windup*

- Care must also be taken so that parameter changes do not cause disturbances

Feedback - Refers to a situation where two (or more) dynamical sustems are connected together such that each system influences the other and their dynamics are thus strongly coupled.

Open Loop: input, r, into system 1, gives output u which is input to system 2, which gives output y.

Closed Loop: input, y, into system 1, gives output u which is input to system 2, which gives output y.

Feedback loop: Central concept in control, senses  a stimulus and compares it to the desired behavior.

Feedforward: Measuring the effect of a disturbance and counteracting it with a control signal before it enters a system.

Negative Feedback: Attempt to regulate a system by reacting to some disturbances in a way that decreases the effect of those disturbances.

Positive Feedback: Increase in some variable or signal that leads to a situation where that quantity is further increased by dynamics.

Simple Forms of Feedback:

On-Off Control: Keeps process close to reference, aka temperature control.

PID Control: Controls for the overreacting observed in on-off control, by using proportional control.

Proportional control: Where the characteristic of the controller is proportional to the control error for small errors.

Intergral Control: Helps to avoid the need for a control signal to keep the value stable in proportional control, by making the control action proportional to the integral of the error. 

Control action (PID): Sum of the proportional control, integral control, and simple error prediction (derivative).

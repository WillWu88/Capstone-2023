In order to begin the PI car project we began by reviewing relevant topics. 

The first of these topics was the [[Linux Command Line]], as some knowledge of navigating the command line is necessary for completing our first task in the project timeline of compiling ROS2 on the Raspberry PI.

The next topic reviewed was the broad topic of feedback systems. The first of the subtopics reviewed was [[Feedback Loops]], as having a good conceptual understanding of how feedback loops play into control is instrumental for beginning to model the PI car and handling the sensors.
